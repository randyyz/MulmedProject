# CodeActiO(n) Website

CodeActiO(n) is a web-based application that supports Algorithm Design and Analysis
course, especially for the topic about time complexity and its type (Constant Time, Linear
Time, Logarithmic Time, Quadratic Time, Exponential Time, and Factorial Time).
CodeActiO(n) is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript language. This web-based
application consists of 3 pages, Home page, Tutorials page, and About Us page.
CodeActiO(n) delivers the explanation about time complexity in video and article. This
application also shows code snippets in C++ language as an example. This application also
shows our partners and testimonies from our subscribers that were displayed in the carousel.
Users could play the background music of Mario Bros Theme Song in the Home page by
clicking play button and pause it by clicking pause button. If users click the Tutorial Video in
Tutorials page, it will link to the YouTube Video that explains the topic.

This project is created as our final project in Multimedia Systems course. The deployed website can be accessed from this link https://randyyz.github.io/MulmedProject/main.html.
